Task 1 Netcat Relay


Objective: You have been provided intel in regards to colecting key intelligence and sensitive data from Donovian Cyberspace, move and redirect all data back to your INTERNET-HOST. A Donovian Insider has stashed important information in the form of JPG images on T2. Each JPG image contains a piece of the message in the form of Steganography. Utilizing Netcat relays, you will use the designated RELAY to transfer the JPG images to your INTERNET-HOST. Once the images are downloaded you will use a command-line tool called steghide to extract the message.
Utilize the targets T1, T2, and RELAY to develop the following netcat relays for use by Gorgan Cyber Forces. The use of names pipes should be utilized on RELAY:
The Donovian Insider provided a image called 1steg.jpg on T2 and is trying to connect to RELAY on TCP port 1234 to send the file. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.
The Donovian Insider provided a image called 2steg.jpg on T2 and is trying to connect to RELAY on TCP port 4321 to send the file. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.
The Donovian Insider provided a image called 3steg.jpg on T2 listening for a connection from RELAY on TCP port 6789. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to make this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.
The Donovian Insider provided a image called 4steg.jpg on T2 listening for a connection from RELAY on TCP port 9876. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to make this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.
Use the syntax: steghide extract -sf [image name] to extract the hidden message. Use password when prompted for a passphrase.


Scheme of Maneuver:
Task 1
> BLUE_HOST-4 (T2) > BLUE_INT_DMZ_HOST-1 (RELAY) > INTERNET_HOST (T1)


Task 2
> INTERNET_HOST (T1)
→ T3
→ T4

Task 3
> INTERNET_HOST (T1)
→ T5


Target Section:

Task 1
T1
Hostname: INTERNET_HOST
External IP: 10.50.26.79 (ALREADY PROVIDED) Internal IP: 10.10.0.40 (ALREADY PROVIDED) (accessed via FLOAT IP)
creds: (ALREADY PROVIDED)
Action: Successfully transfer file data between hosts via Netcat

T2
Hostname: BLUE_HOST-4
IP: 172.16.82.115
creds: (NONE)
Action: Successfully transfer files from this host using Netcat

RELAY
Hostname: BLUE_INT_DMZ_HOST-1
IP: 172.16.40.10
creds: (ALREADY PROVIDED)
Action: Successfully transfer file data between hosts via Netcat

T1 = 10.50.26.79    #us
T2 = 172.16.82.115    #BLUE_HOST-4
Relay = 172.16.40.10  #BLUE_INT_DMZ_HOST-1

# 1
T2 > RELAY on TCP port 1234 > T1
1steg.jpg on T2
Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1
Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.
