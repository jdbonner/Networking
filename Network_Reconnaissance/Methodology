Net Recon Methodology

Host discovery
ruby ping sweep (if ping available)
for i in {1..254};do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i 2>/dev/null | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
nmap scan if no ping (Check scan methodology below)
port discovery
nmap (check scan methodology below)
nc scan script
port validation
banner grab using nc [ip addr][port]
follow-on actions based on ports found
if 21 or 80 wget -r [ip addr] (or) wget -r ftp://[ip addr] (or) firefox
if 22 or 23 connect and passive recond
if no 22 or 23 and you need to get on the box and you have prot 21
ftp [ip addr] connects to ftp server
passive
ls
get [file name]


scan methodology
nmap -Pn [ip addr] -T4 -p 21-23,80

quick scan ports 21-23,80
specific ports based on hitns/clues found
well known port range
which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet get curl ping

0-1023 (actually scan 1-1023)
chunks of 2000 or first 10000 ports (65535)
hail mary - scan all the ports (65535)



passive recon methodology
italizied/bolded words are ommands

hostname
permissions
sudo -l
interfaces and subnets
ip a
show interface (VYOS)
neighbors
ip neigh
routing table
ip route
show ip route (VYOS)
files of interest 
find / -iname flag*
find / -iname hint*
other listening ports
ss -ntlp
available tools
which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet get curl ping
